## 📌 Projects

### 1️⃣ Weather Data Analysis
Analyze historical weather data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.

**Key Steps:**
- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, fixing formats, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics, trend detection, and seasonal analysis.
- **Visualization:** Line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- **Insights:** Understanding temperature variations, rainfall trends, and extreme weather events.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Example Outputs:**
- Temperature trends over time  
- Rainfall distribution per month  
- Seasonal variation heatmaps
